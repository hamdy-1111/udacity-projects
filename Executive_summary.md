1. Introduction
Overview:
On 2020 , a cyberattack was detected involving multiple failed login attempts and a potential malware infection on the processing plantâ€™s server. The attack was linked to the National Peace Agency, an advanced infiltration group. The investigation aimed to detect, mitigate, and secure the system from further compromise.

Objectives:

To identify and analyze threats using ClamAV and other tools.
To implement measures to mitigate the identified threats.
To harden the system against future attacks.
2. Threat Detection
ClamAV Scan:
A comprehensive scan was performed on the /home/ubuntu/Downloads/ directory using ClamAV. The scan identified several malware files, which were documented in the clamAV_report.txt file.

Suspicious File Identification:
Additional analysis of files in the Downloads folder revealed a suspicious file that evaded ClamAV detection. This file was investigated for embedded callout URLs, which were reported in the suspicious_file_report.txt file.

Yara Rule Creation:
A Yara rule was created to detect the unique malware identified. The rule was saved as unknown_threat.yara and compiled with ClamAV to enhance detection capabilities.

3. Threat Mitigation
Implement HIDS:
The Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) was verified by monitoring real-time logs. A successful SSH login was captured and documented in succesful_ssh_logon.png, which was uploaded to the /starter/section_2/ directory on GitHub.

Locate Suspicious IP:
Logs were analyzed to locate the IP address involved in the attack. The IP address was identified through multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login and reported in attacker_IP.txt.

IPtables Rule:
An IPtables rule was implemented to block future SSH connection requests from the attacking IP. The rule was documented in Iptable_rule.txt.

Detect Backdoor Username, Process & Port:
The system was analyzed to detect a backdoor username, process, and non-standard port. Details of the rogue username, malicious process, and port were reported in backdoor_details.txt. The rogue username was deleted, and the backdoor process was terminated to eliminate persistence.

Disable SSH Root Access:
SSH configuration was updated to disallow root login. Changes were made in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and documented with a snapshot named remote_config_change.jpg.

4. System Hardening
OpenVAS Scan:
An OpenVAS vulnerability scan was performed to identify system vulnerabilities. The results were captured in openvas_vulnerability_report.png.

Patching Apache:
The Apache HTTP server was configured to hide the version banner. The current version and changes were reported in apache_version_patching.txt.

De-Privilege Apache Account:
A new user group (apache-group) and user (apache-user) were created. Apache was configured to run with this low-privileged account. Configuration changes were detailed in apache_user_account.txt.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations
Incident Resolution:
The cyberattack was successfully contained through malware detection, IP blocking, system hardening, and process termination. The system is now secured against similar threats.

Recommendations:

Regular updates and scans with updated security tools.
Enhanced monitoring and logging for early detection of suspicious activities.
Review and update security policies and configurations periodically.
