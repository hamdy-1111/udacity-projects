Rogue Username: darklord
Malicious Process: /tmp/remotesec
Listening Port: 56565

Justification:
- The username `darklord` was found in the /etc/passwd file.
- The process `/tmp/remotesec` was found running as root, and it is not part of the normal system processes.
- The process is listening on a non-standard port (56565), indicating it might be a backdoor.
